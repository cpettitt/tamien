This project represents a personal exploration of the underpinnings of
functional programming. My goal is to write a statically-typed functional
programming language that looks similar to Haskell. Ultimately, I'm more
interested in the journey, and the associated learning proccess, than the
destination.

# References

I intend to take advantage of freely available publications for building
functional programming languages. "The Implementation of Functional Programming
Languages" seems to be an excellent place to start, and I intended to make much
use of it.  Other references will be added as I use them.
